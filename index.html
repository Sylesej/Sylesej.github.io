<p>I am a mechanical engineering student at the <a href="http://www.dtu.dk/english">Technical University of Denmark</a>.<br>
When i am not studying i enjoy riding bikes, both on the road and in the woods. I am currently working on a fuel efficient viechle as a part of the DTU Roadrunners projects.  </p>

<a id="study" class="anchor" href="#study" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Study</h2>

<p>As a part of my education i am taking courses on mechanics, such as beam theory and continuum mechanics, and i would like to learn Finite Element Method as well, since i do enjoy simulation and modelling, therefore i have courses on programming and numerical methods as well.<br>
I am currently on my second year of my bachelors degree, and is going to study as an exchange student at Aalto University (Finland) next semester, fall 2015.</p>

<a id="biking" class="anchor" href="#biking" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Biking</h2>

<p>I got into mountain biking when i was about 12, and has been riding since. Later i started doing road racing as well.<br>
Now i mostly ride cross country since that is what the terrain where i live allows for, but i do like riding in real mountains and going for full day trips.<br>
I did achieve a 3rd at the Nordic Championships in u17 XC, and i consider that my best result, and have not been in a simmilar shape since. I am currently racing in the danish class B.</p>

<p>As a part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTU_Roadrunners">DTU Roadrunners</a> project about building an ecocar i am working on carbon fibre composite components for the current Urban Concept class car, such as a roolhoop and wheel-enclosure.</p>

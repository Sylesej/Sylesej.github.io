{"name":"Nils Toudal","tagline":"Student and Mountainbiker.","body":"### Nils Toudal\r\nI am a mechanical engineering student at the [Technical University of Denmark](http://www.dtu.dk/english).  \r\nWhen i am not studying i enjoy riding bikes, both on the road and in the woods. I am currently working on a fuel efficient viechle as a part of the DTU Roadrunners projects.  \r\n\r\n##Study\r\nAs a part of my education i am taking courses on mechanics, such as beam theory and continuum mechanics, and i would like to learn Finite Element Method as well, since i do enjoy simulation and modelling, therefore i have courses on programming and numerical methods as well.  \r\nI am currently on my second year of my bachelors degree, and is going to study as an exchange student at Aalto University (Finland) next semester, fall 2015.\r\n\r\n##Biking\r\nI got into mountain biking when i was about 12, and has been riding since. Later i started doing road racing as well.  \r\nNow i mostly ride cross country since that is what the terrain where i live allows for, but i do like riding in real mountains and going for full day trips.  \r\nI did achieve a 3rd at the Nordic Championships in u17 XC, and i consider that my best result, and have not been in a simmilar shape since. I am currently racing in the danish class B.\r\n\r\n##DTU Roadrunners\r\nAs a part of the [DTU Roadrunners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTU_Roadrunners) project about building an ecocar i am working on carbon fibre composite components for the current Urban Concept class car, such as a roolhoop and wheel-enclosure.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
